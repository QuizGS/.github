# QuizGS
A GenSpark application for reviewing and quizzing relevant information.


## 🌈 Contribution guidelines:
More might be added later! Currently contribution is only internal. Our git flow:
- always use different branches for each feature
- use a pull request (via GitHub) to merge, and ask sometime to take a peek at your code before it's merged :)
- then, merge it into the `development` branch once it's done (we'll have a test site deployed here)
- then, every so often, we'll merge it into the `main` branch (which is where we'll deploy the production site from)

and anytime you start a new feature you'll want to:
- switch and pull from the `development` branch
- ensure no one else is working on the files you're going to be working on
- create an appropriately named feature branch i.e. `quiz-list-view`
